# Swatchbook

A Markdown-powered style binder for GNOME. Write colour palettes, typography specs, and design tokens in plain Markdown; Swatchbook renders them as an interactive, shareable swatch canvas.

Built with Rust, GTK4, Libadwaita, and Blueprint — looks and behaves like a first-party GNOME application.

## Features

- Live Markdown-to-swatch preview with 150 ms debounce
- Supports `#rrggbb`, `#rgb`, `rgb()`, and CSS named colours
- Sections map to headed groups of swatches
- Open, save, and save-as with native file dialogs
- Auto-save every 30 seconds with crash recovery
- Dark mode — follows the system colour scheme automatically
- Responsive layout — collapses to single-column on narrow displays
- Spanish translation included

## Install

Download the latest `.deb` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/PAumedes/swatchbook/releases) and install or upgrade with:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i swatchbook-<version>-amd64.deb
```

This works for both fresh installs and upgrades. Double-clicking the `.deb` in the App Center will show "Installed" rather than "Update" — use the terminal command above to upgrade.

**Runtime requirements:** GTK 4.10+ and Libadwaita 1.4+ (included in Ubuntu 24.04+, Fedora 39+).

## Usage

Write your palette in the left-hand editor using this syntax:

```markdown
## Brand Colours

- **Primary** — `#4a90d9`
- **Accent** — `#e8a838`
- **Background** — `rgb(245, 245, 245)`
- **Danger** — `red`
```

The canvas on the right updates live as you type. Use `Ctrl+S` to save your binder as a plain `.md` file you can open in any editor.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| New window | `Ctrl+N` |
| Open file | `Ctrl+O` |
| Save | `Ctrl+S` |
| Save as | `Ctrl+Shift+S` |
| Quit | `Ctrl+Q` |

## Building

All compilation happens inside an [Incus](https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/) container — no build dependencies need to be installed locally.

### Quick start

```bash
make build        # build .deb via Incus container
make install-deb  # install the built package
```

### All Makefile targets

```bash
make              # show help
make build        # build release .deb via Incus
make build-dev    # build debug binary inside container
make rebuild      # clean + full build
make test         # run Meson + Cargo tests inside container
make lint         # cargo clippy + fmt check
make fmt          # auto-format Rust source
make container-up     # start/create the build container
make container-stop   # stop the container
make container-shell  # open a shell inside the container
make release-patch    # bump patch version and publish
make release-minor    # bump minor version and publish
make release-major    # bump major version and publish
make release-watch    # stream the GitHub Actions CI log live
make release-status   # show recent CI runs and published releases
make changelog        # print the full changelog
make clean            # remove build tree inside container
make install-deb      # install swatchbook.deb locally
make uninstall        # uninstall the package
```

### Shell tab-completion

```bash
source build-aux/make-completion.bash
```

Add that line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` for persistent completion.

### Container setup

The first `make build` creates and configures the container automatically. If your Incus project uses a restricted network, see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for the static IP workaround.

## Releasing a new version

Swatchbook uses a one-command release flow. When you push a version tag, GitHub Actions builds the `.deb` and publishes it to the Releases page automatically.

```bash
make release-patch   # 0.2.0 → 0.2.1  (bug fix)
make release-minor   # 0.2.0 → 0.3.0  (new feature)
make release-major   # 0.2.0 → 1.0.0  (milestone / breaking change)
```

Each command will:
1. Ask for a one-line changelog entry
2. Bump the version in `Cargo.toml`, `meson.build`, and `build-aux/control`
3. Prepend an entry to `build-aux/changelog` and `data/…metainfo.xml`
4. Commit, tag, and push to GitHub
5. GitHub Actions builds the `.deb` in the cloud (~4 min)
6. The `.deb` is attached to a GitHub Release automatically

Watch the build:
```bash
make release-watch    # live log stream
make release-status   # summary of recent runs
```

See [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) for the full release process.
